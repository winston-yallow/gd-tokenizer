Google Fonts ZIP
=================================

This directory contains Fira Code as both a variable font and static fonts.

Fira Code is a variable font family that has the following axes: wght. This means
all the styles are contained in a single file, FiraCode-VariableFont:wght.ttf.
Not all apps support variable fonts, in those cases you can use the static font
files for Fira Code:

  FiraCode-Light.ttf -- 300 weight
  FiraCode-Regular.ttf -- 400 weight
  FiraCode-Medium.ttf -- 500 weight
  FiraCode-SemiBold.ttf -- 600 weight
  FiraCode-Bold.ttf -- 700 weight

Get started
---------------------------------

Step 1 - Install the font files you want to use

Step 2 - Use your app's font picker to view the font family and all the
available styles

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that weren’t available before. If your app doesn’t support variable fonts, then
you can use the static font files.
